# Git

Type: `backup`  
Enabled by default: `true`

Pushes to a remote origin whenever you are done rebuilding / live editing (unless you answer barelys exit prompt wih "no" or "publish only").

**Note:** git has to be installed. On Windows, GitHub Desktop is **not** sufficient. Check with `git --version`.

**Note**: the repository and its origin have to already be initialized. This plugin can not do that for you.
