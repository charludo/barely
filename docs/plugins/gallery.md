# Gallery

Type: `content`  
Enabled by default: `true`

Turn simple markdown into a list of images (aka, a gallery).

Default priority is lower than that of Pixelizer, meaning the Gallery will receive the full optimization benefits of Pixelizer.

---

Markdown-Syntax:

```md
[name <sort> <direction>]!!(image-folder)
```

The name of the gallery and the image folder are required. Sorting key and direction are optional; however, it is not possible to specify `direction` without `sort`, since these are positional arguments.

Each image will receive an `alt` tag consisting of the gallery name, and the image's position within the gallery.
